    <p>Brian Acton and Jan Koum founded WhatsApp in 2009 after they left their job at Yahoo!. The startup story began when they left their job to travel around the world. But soon, their savings started to sink, and they had to apply for a job on Facebook,
        which didnt work out as planned as well. They were quite disappointed, but this failure led them to start a new life journey – WhatsApp.Jan Koum bought an iPhone in January 2009 and soon realised the app industry’s potential on few months old
        App Store. He wanted to build an app that shows statuses next to the individual names of the users. Koum discussed the idea with Acton, and both started visiting Alex Fishman for more insights. But executing this idea was impossible without the
        help of an iOS developer. So, Alex introduced them to a Russian developer, Igor Solomennikov, whom he found on RentACoder.com. The beginning of the journey was not a smooth one, but they paved their way through like many other successful entrepreneurs.
        Koum succeeded in developing the iOS application and incorporated the ‘WhatsApp inc.’ in California on 24th February 2009 He named it ‘WhatsApp’ because it sounded more like what’s up, which aligned with the idea of statuses. He demoed WhatsApp
        to some friends, including Fisherman, but none of them liked it. Moreover, issues like battery draining, crashing of the app, etc. made Koum so disappointed that he lost all the hope and started to look for a new job. At that time, Acton encouraged
        by saying 2009: WhatsApp was founded by Jan Koum and Brian Acton, both former employees of Yahoo. 2009: The first version of WhatsApp was released on the App Store. 2010: WhatsApp transitioned to a paid service to avoid advertisements. 2011: WhatsApp

        immensely popular. In 2014, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, marking one of the largest tech acquisitions in history. Under Facebook's ownership, WhatsApp continued to grow, adding features like voice and video calls, and expanding
        its user base to over 2 billion by 2021. The platform's success lies in its commitment to privacy and its straightforward, user-friendly interface.

    <h2 id="facebook">FaceBook</h2>
    <img src="./Images/facebook.png" width="150px" height="150px">
    <p>Facebook, the brainchild of Mark Zuckerberg, was launched in February 2004 from a Harvard University dormitory. Initially called "The Facebook," it was designed to connect college students. The platform's rapid growth led to its expansion beyond universities,
        becoming available to the general public by 2006. Facebook introduced innovative features such as the News Feed, the "Like" button, and a robust advertising system that allowed businesses to target specific demographics. Despite facing numerous
        controversies over privacy and data handling, Facebook became the world's largest social network, boasting nearly 3 billion monthly active users by 2021. Its acquisitions, including Instagram and WhatsApp, further cemented its dominance in the
        social media sphere.Facebook, American online social media platform and social network service that is part of the company Meta Platforms. Facebook was founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, all
        of whom were students at Harvard University. Facebook became the largest social network in the world, with nearly three billion users as of 2021, and about half that number were using Facebook every day. The company’s headquarters are in Menlo
        Park, California. Access to Facebook is free of charge, and the company earns most of its money from advertisements on the website. New users can create profiles, upload photos, join a preexisting group, and start new groups. The site has many
        components, including Timeline, a space on each user’s profile page where users can post their content and friends can post messages; Status, which enables users to alert friends to their current location or situation; and News Feed, which informs
        users of changes to their friends’ profiles and status. Users can chat with each other and send each other private messages. Users can signal their approval of content on Facebook with the Like button, a feature that also appears on many other
        websites. Other services that are part of Meta Platforms are Instagram, a photo- and video-sharing social network; Messenger, an instant-messaging application; and WhatsApp, a text-message and VoIP service. The attractiveness of Facebook stems
        in part from cofounder Zuckerberg’s insistence from the very beginning that members be transparent about who they are; users are forbidden from adopting false identities. The company’s management argued that transparency is necessary for forming
        personal relationships, sharing ideas and information, and building up society as a whole. It also noted that the bottom-up, peer-to-peer connectivity among Facebook users makes it easier for businesses to connect their products with consumers.

    <h2 id="instagram">Instagram</h2>
    <img src="./Images/instagram.jpg" width="150px" height="150px">
    <p>Instagram was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, launching in October 2010. The app focused on photo sharing, with filters and editing tools that enhanced user creativity. Instagram quickly gained popularity, amassing over a million users
        within two months of its launch. In 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram for approximately $1 billion. Post-acquisition, Instagram introduced several new features such as Stories, IGTV, and Reels, which kept the platform competitive with rivals like
        Snapchat and TikTok. By 2021, Instagram had over 1 billion monthly active users, making it one of the most influential social networks globally.Instagram originated with Stanford graduate Kevin Systrom, who had previously worked at Google. His
        initial creation was Burbn, so named because of his interest in whiskey and bourbon. Inspired by the popularity of Foursquare and other location-based platforms, Burbn allowed users to post check-ins along with photos, which were not yet a staple
        of social posting. Systrom secured venture funding for Burbn and went on to recruit fellow Stanford graduate Mike Krieger, who had worked on the social media platform Meebo. They reworked the concept to focus on photographs taken on mobile devices
        and renamed it Instagram. Systrom and Krieger embraced minimalism with their prototype, concentrating on images (with the option to add filters), comments, and “liking” features. The duo also decided to eschew a Web version for an iOS app that
        would capitalize on the much improved photographic capabilities of the iPhone 4. They finalized the app in a few months, posting the platform’s first photos in July 2010. Instagram was released to the public in Apple’s App Store on October 6,
        2010, and reached 25,000 users on its first day. Less than three months later it had one million users, a phenomenal achievement. 2010: Instagram was founded by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. 2010: The Instagram app was launched on iOS. 2011:

    <h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>
    <img src="./Images/twitter.png" width="150px" height="150px">
    <p> Twitter, launched in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone, Noah Glass, and Evan Williams, offered a new way to communicate through short messages called tweets, limited to 140 characters (later expanded to 280). Twitter's real-time nature made it
        a powerful tool for news dissemination, public discussions, and social movements. Hashtags, introduced in 2007, became a hallmark of the platform, organizing content around specific topics. Despite challenges such as handling misinformation and
        harassment, Twitter grew to over 330 million monthly active users by 2021. Its influence is particularly notable in politics, entertainment, and global events.Twitter began as an idea that Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey (@Jack) had in 2006. Dorsey
        had originally imagined Twitter as an SMS-based communications platform. Groups of friends could keep tabs on what each other were doing based on their status updates. Like texting, but not. During a brainstorming session at the podcasting company
        Odeo, Dorsey proposed this SMS-based platform to Odeo's co-founder Evan Williams (@Ev). Evan and his co-founder Biz Stone (@Biz) by extension gave Jack the go-ahead to spend more time on the project and develop it further. In its early days, Twitter
        was referred to as twttr. At the time, a popular trend, sometimes to gain a domain-name advantage, was to drop vowels in the name of their companies and services. Software developer Noah Glass (@Noah) is credited with coming up with the original
        name twttr as well as its final incarnation as Twitter. 2006: Twitter was founded by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams. 2006: The first tweet was sent by Jack Dorsey: "just setting up my twttr." 2007: Twitter gained popularity

        History of WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube The development of social media platforms over the past two decades has dramatically transformed the way people communicate and interact. Each platform, with its unique history and
        purpose, has contributed significantly to the landscape of digital communication. WhatsApp, founded in 2009 by former Yahoo employees Jan Koum and Brian Acton, revolutionized mobile messaging. Initially developed as a status update application
        for iPhone, it quickly evolved into a full-fledged messaging service. The simplicity, reliability, and end-to-end encryption features of WhatsApp made it immensely popular. In 2014, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, marking one of the

        in December 2002 by Reid Hoffman and a team of co-founders, launched in May 2003. It was designed as a professional networking site, allowing users to create profiles, connect with colleagues, and share career-related information. LinkedIn differentiated
        itself from other social platforms by focusing on business and employment-related services. It introduced features like job postings, company pages, and a premium subscription model that offered enhanced networking opportunities. Microsoft acquired
        LinkedIn in 2016 for $26.2 billion, integrating it with its suite of business products. LinkedIn's user base grew to over 700 million by 2021, establishing it as the leading professional networking platform.LinkedIn is a business-oriented social
        media platform and social networking website founded in 2002 and headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. In 2016, software and cloud computing giant Microsoft acquired the company in a deal valued at $26 billion. Unlike other social networks such
        as Facebook and Myspace, which are often purely recreational, LinkedIn emphasizes a user’s professional connections. Users create profile pages that have a structure similar to a résumé, in that users can summarize their career, advertise their
        particular skills, and list their education and employment history. Connections are formed between users when one accepts an invitation from another to join his or her network. LinkedIn allows users to further their careers by searching for jobs,
        finding connections (even at third hand) at a particular company, and receiving recommendations from other users. Membership is free; however, with payment for premium service, users can receive more profiles in their search results and see full
        profiles of any LinkedIn user. Venture capitalist Reid Hoffman, product designer Allen Blue, marketing professional Konstantin Guericke, engineer Eric Ly, and engineer Jean-Luc Vaillant founded LinkedIn, and the Web site was launched in 2003.
        Growth was slow at first. In 2005 LinkedIn introduced services that allowed companies to post job listings and search the network for prospective employees. In addition to these professional services, LinkedIn allows companies to advertise on
        the site. LinkedIn finally became profitable in 2007. That year LinkedIn had more than 15 million members, and by 2011 LinkedIn had more than 100 million members worldwide. LinkedIn’s initial public offering (IPO) that same year raised $353 million.
        In 2016 LinkedIn was acquired by Microsoft for approximately $26 billion. As of 2024, the LinkedIn platform hosts over a billion members from over 200 countries. In its 2023 fiscal year, Microsoft reported global revenue of $15 billion from its
        LinkedIn division, with $7 billion coming from hiring software aimed at company recruiters, and $1.7 billion from sales of premium subscriptions. 2002: LinkedIn was founded by Reid Hoffman and a team of former colleagues from Socialnet.com and

    <h2 id="youtube">YouTube</h2>
    <img src="./Images/youtube.png" width="150px" height="150px">
    <p> YouTube, founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim, launched in February 2005, providing a platform for users to upload, share, and view videos. The ease of use and the ability to reach a global audience quickly made YouTube a cultural phenomenon.
        Google acquired YouTube in November 2006 for $1.65 billion in stock. Under Google's ownership, YouTube expanded its offerings to include monetization options for content creators, live streaming, and premium subscription services like YouTube
        Red (now YouTube Premium). By 2021, YouTube had over 2 billion logged-in monthly users, with content ranging from music videos and vlogs to educational channels and livestreams. YouTube, social media platform and website for sharing videos. It
        was registered on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim, three former employees of the American e-commerce company PayPal. They had the idea that ordinary people would enjoy sharing their “home videos.” The company is
        headquartered in San Bruno, California. Shortly after the site opened on a limited (“beta”) basis in May 2005, it was attracting some 30,000 visitors per day. By the time YouTube was officially launched on December 15, 2005, it was serving more
        than two million video views each day. By January 2006 that number had increased to more than 25 million views. The number of videos available at the site surpassed 25 million in March 2006, with more than 20,000 new videos uploaded on a daily
        basis. By the summer of 2006, YouTube was serving more than 100 million videos per day, and the number of videos being uploaded to the site showed no sign of slowing down.The immense growth in traffic at YouTube created its own set of problems.
        The company continually had to purchase more computer equipment and more broadband connections to the Internet. In addition, YouTube was forced to allocate more financial resources for potential litigation, as many media companies discovered that
        some of the videos uploaded to YouTube contained copyrighted material. With limited success in commercializing its Web site or containing its growing costs, YouTube began looking for a buyer. In 2005 the American search engine company Google Inc.
        had launched a video service, Google Video, but it failed to generate much traffic, and Google was prompted to purchase YouTube for $1.65 billion in stock in November 2006. Rather than merging the Web sites, however, Google continued YouTube’s
        operation as before. To reduce the risk of copyright-infringement lawsuits, Google negotiated deals with a number of entertainment companies that would allow copyrighted video material to appear on YouTube and would give YouTube users the right
        to include certain copyrighted songs in their videos. It also agreed to remove tens of thousands of copyrighted video files from YouTube. In November 2008 Google reached an agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. (MGM), to show some of the studio’s
        full-length movies and television shows, the broadcasts being free to watch, with advertisements running alongside the programs. 2005: YouTube was founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. 2005: The first video, "Me at the zoo," was
        uploaded by Jawed Karim. 2006: Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in stock. 2007: YouTube launched its Partner Program, enabling creators to earn revenue. 2009: YouTube surpassed 1 billion video views per day. 2010: YouTube introduced support
        for 4K video. 2012: YouTube launched its first original channels initiative. 2015: YouTube introduced YouTube Red (later YouTube Premium), a subscription service. 2015: YouTube Gaming was launched to compete with Twitch. 2017: YouTube TV, a live
        television streaming service, was introduced. 2018: YouTube faced criticism and policy changes related to content moderation. 2019: YouTube Kids was launched to provide a safer environment for children. 2020: YouTube introduced Shorts, a short-form
